A simple Rampart-like game. 

Build walls around the castle in the center.  Monsters will approach from the edges of the screen, and try to eat the walls to reach the castle. The game is over when the monsters reach the castle and eat its health down to zero.

* You can't place walls on top of each other. Only in empty spaces.
* If you drop walls on top of monsters it kills them, but more will keep coming.
